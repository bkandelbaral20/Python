# Reading input from Keyboard 
1. Use 3 different variables that holds 3 different values from standadrd input- an integer, a double, and a string respectively. On on eline, print this variable in reverse order with exactly one space between each. on second line, print them in original order

// input is always in string so we need to parse it values
k = int(input()) 
d = float(input())
s = input()
print(s,d,k) // printing in reverse order
print(k,d,s) // original order
